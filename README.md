# 📘 Java Basics – Learning Notes & Quick Recall

This repository contains my Java basics learnings, notes, and small experiments collected while following structured video tutorials.  
The primary goal of this repo is quick recall, concept reinforcement, and reference—not full-scale production projects.

For larger and more structured Java projects, I have created a separate repository.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Acts as a personal Java notebook
- Enables fast revision (15-30 seconds per concept)
- Stores small code snippets and mini experiments
- Helps quickly recall how and why a Java concept works

Think of this repository as Java flashcards written in code form.

## 📚 Learning Sources

The content in this repository is based on learnings from the following tutorials:

### Apna College (Hindi)
https://youtu.be/UmnCZ7-9yDY  
- Used for quick surface-level understanding
- Focuses on fundamentals and syntax familiarity
- Ideal for fast onboarding and revision

### BroCode (English)
https://youtu.be/xTtL8E4LzTQ  
- Used for deeper understanding of each topic
- Explains concepts with reasoning and practical usage
- Involves building alongside projects and real examples

Both resources are used together:
- Apna College for quick conceptual clarity
- BroCode for depth, structure, and best practices

## 🗂️ File Naming Convention

### Files ending with `_p.java`
- Learned from Apna College
- Very basic and surface-level
- Intended for quick 10–15 second revision
- Covers only what the concept is and its simplest usage


---

### Files without `_p.java`
- Learned from BroCode
- Contain detailed explanations and cleaner logic
- Focus on practical understanding and proper coding style
- May include extended examples or mini implementations


---

## 🧪 Mini Projects

This repository also includes a few basic mini projects created while learning Java concepts.  
These projects are exploratory and meant for applying concepts immediately after learning them.

Larger and more structured Java projects are maintained in a separate repository.

---

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

- Open a file and skim through comments for fast recall
- Use `_p.java` files for rapid revision before exams or interviews
- Use non-`_p` files for deeper conceptual refresh
- Treat this repository as a Java cheatbook rather than a project showcase

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

Learning is more effective when:
- Concepts are written in your own words
- Code is revisited instead of only watching tutorials
- Recall and clarity are prioritized over perfection

This repository is intentionally simple, practical, and recall-oriented.
