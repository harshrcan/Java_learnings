# 📘 Java Basics – Quick Recall Notes

> **Note:** This repository is designed strictly for **speed and concept recall**. It focuses on surface-level syntax and fundamentals, not deep production-level implementation.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository acts as a **Java flashcard notebook**. It is intended for:
* ⚡ **10–30 second revision** per concept.
* 📝 **Basic syntax** reference.
* 🧠 **Memory triggers** (recalling what a concept is and how it looks).

*Think of this as a "Java Cheat Sheet" written for speed, not depth.*

## 📚 Learning Sources
The primary source for these notes is **Apna College (Hindi)**.

* 📺 **Source:** [Java Placement Course - Apna College](https://youtu.be/UmnCZ7-9yDY)
* **Focus:** Quick onboarding and syntax familiarity.
* **Use Case:** Rapid revision before exams or interviews.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This repository does **not** contain detailed explanations or BroCode-style deep dives.

## 🗂️ File Naming Convention (`*_p.java`)
All files in this repository follow a specific naming convention to distinguish them as "practice/preliminary" notes.

| Suffix | Meaning | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `_p.java` | **Practice / Preliminary.** Basic, surface-level notes based on Apna College learnings. | `operators_p.java`, `loops_p.java` |

## 📦 Context: This vs. Deep Learning Repo
I maintain two separate repositories to separate **speed** from **depth**.

| **This Repository** 🚀 | **Detailed Repository** 🧠 |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source:** Apna College | **Source:** BroCode |
| Lightweight & Fast | Structured & In-depth |
| Syntax & Recall | Best Practices & Theory |
| "What is this?" | "Why does this work?" |

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open any `_p.java` file.
2. Skim the comments and code for instant recall.
3. Use immediately before **exams**, **interviews**, or when **switching back to Java**.

## 🧪 Philosophy
* **Recall > Perfection** (at this stage).
* **Writing Code > Watching Tutorials.**
* **Simplicity reduces cognitive load.**
